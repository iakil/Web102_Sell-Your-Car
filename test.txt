I consistently delivered high-quality data products, including QN, PQDR, and SDR reports, tailored to customer needs with timeliness and precision. Even when reports were assigned last minute, I ensured they were completed without delay, maintaining service excellence. I also completed numerous ad hoc data requests, often with quick turnaround, delivering accurate and relevant insights that supported decision-making. I proactively filled in for colleagues during critical absences, including independently generating the PR MTD report, a foundational report used by QA and other teams. By ensuring it was delivered on time while the analyst was out, I helped maintain operational continuity across departments. These efforts earned recognition from leadership, including a coin from the Deputy Commander for impactful contributions to the DLA mission.
