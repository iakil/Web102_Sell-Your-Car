2. Analyze and Summarize Data Results – Outstanding

I provided in-depth analyses and summaries of customer data that went beyond standard expectations. I not only resolved anomalies and validation errors efficiently but also delivered actionable insights and process improvement suggestions to both customers and internal teams. I led the knowledge transfer of PQDR and SDR reports to the BAEO team, guiding them through complex data interpretation and validation. Additionally, I optimized reporting workflows by modifying and streamlining SAS code to enhance execution speed and reliability, ensuring reports ran more efficiently. My proactive involvement in improving report accuracy, clarity, and performance positioned me as a go-to resource for data analytics support across multiple teams.

4. Support Audit Sustainment & Records Management – Outstanding

(Updated section)
I ensured audit continuity and records accuracy through diligent oversight and timely execution of essential reports during critical staff absences. I maintained proper documentation, shared knowledge with peers, and ensured all data products were audit-ready. When a critical SAS script was lost and support from J6 was unsuccessful, I independently revived and reconstructed the code, restoring essential reporting capability. My proactive engagement in training and mentoring other teams, particularly during the BAEO transition, contributed to long-term sustainability and readiness. I handled SOPs and records management with minimal supervision, modeling accountability and excellence in data stewardship.

5. Knowledge & Application of Data Analytic Tools & Source Data – Outstanding

(Updated section)
This year, I developed and deployed the Skill Query Training Tool (SQATT) using React — an enterprise-level innovation that supports workforce development through targeted skill assessment and training. I utilized tools such as SAS and SQVI to manage and analyze complex datasets, modifying existing SAS scripts to run faster and more efficiently when needed. I also independently recovered critical lost SAS code where J6 support had fallen short. I successfully revived and completed two RPA projects (TQPQ and FRC) that had been stagnant for 3–4 years, overcoming technical and collaborative challenges where others had failed. I continuously collaborated with J6 to identify and resolve UiPath package and library issues, offering alternative solutions that improved RPA reliability. I also supported the BP team with their automation needs, applying my broad technical skillset to assist wherever needed.
